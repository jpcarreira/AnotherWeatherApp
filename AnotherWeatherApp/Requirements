The task is to create a simple but polished app for displaying weather information for your
favorite locations using the iOS 11 SDK frameworks and storyboards only. Avoid using third-party
libraries and frameworks for this task. Your views must use auto-layout and support both portrait
and landscape.

The specifications for the app is as follows:
- At first launch an empty view is shown hinting the user to add a location.
- The user may then tap a navigation bar item to show a modal search view allowing the user to
search for and select a location.
- Tapping on one of the search results in the search view will add it as a favorite location in the
main view and the search view is automatically dismissed (user should also be able to tap cancel).
- The favorite locations show the name of the location along with weather information such as
temperature, weather condition (text and icon) and wind speed/direction.
- The user should be able to edit the list of locations by tapping an edit button to delete one or
more locations, and also change the order of those locations. A location may also be deleted with a
swipe gesture revealing a delete option.
- The user may pull the view down to refresh the weather information.

Note:
- You may use either Swift or Objective-C.
- The weather locations, weather data, and order of locations need to be persisted in some way.
- Use the following third-party weather API for retreiving weather data and locations:
